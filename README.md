## JavaScript animation example

In the persuit of trying to create a star field animation for a web page, I realized I don't know near enough about animation on websites.  

I do have a bit of experience with python packages such as pygame and Tkinter, so I had a lot of background to help guide me through what I might need to do for this.  But in keeping with my desire to help others learn what I couldn't easily find, I have created this webpage, and a blog post so that others can use the code as a base experiment model, and learn from it.
